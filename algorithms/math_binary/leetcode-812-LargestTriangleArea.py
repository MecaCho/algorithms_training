812. Largest Triangle Area
Given an array of points on the X-Y plane points where points[i] = [xi, yi], return the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any three different points. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

 

Example 1:


Input: points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: The five points are shown in the above figure. The red triangle is the largest.
Example 2:

Input: points = [[1,0],[0,0],[0,1]]
Output: 0.50000
 

Constraints:

3 <= points.length <= 50
-50 <= xi, yi <= 50
All the given points are unique.
