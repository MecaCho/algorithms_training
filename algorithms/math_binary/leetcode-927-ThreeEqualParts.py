927. Three Equal Parts
You are given an array arr which consists of only zeros and ones, divide the array into three non-empty parts such that all of these parts represent the same binary value.

If it is possible, return any [i, j] with i + 1 < j, such that:

arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[i] is the first part,
arr[i + 1], arr[i + 2], ..., arr[j - 1] is the second part, and
arr[j], arr[j + 1], ..., arr[arr.length - 1] is the third part.
All three parts have equal binary values.
If it is not possible, return [-1, -1].

Note that the entire part is used when considering what binary value it represents. For example, [1,1,0] represents 6 in decimal, not 3. Also, leading zeros are allowed, so [0,1,1] and [1,1] represent the same value.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,0,1,0,1]
Output: [0,3]
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,1,0,1,1]
Output: [-1,-1]
Example 3:

Input: arr = [1,1,0,0,1]
Output: [0,2]
 

Constraints:

3 <= arr.length <= 3 * 104
arr[i] is 0 or 1

'''
先统计1的个数cnt，若cnt = 0 代表能够任意划分，直接返回 [0, 2]
若cnt不为3的倍数，必然不能正常划分，返回无解 [-1, -1]
最后检查三段中 1 的间隔位是否相同，后缀 0 个数是否相同
