771. Jewels and Stones
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
Note:

S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
The characters in J are distinct.

771. 宝石与石头
 给定字符串J 代表石头中宝石的类型，和字符串 S代表你拥有的石头。 S 中每个字符代表了一种你拥有的石头的类型，你想知道你拥有的石头中有多少是宝石。

J 中的字母不重复，J 和 S中的所有字符都是字母。字母区分大小写，因此"a"和"A"是不同类型的石头。

示例 1:

输入: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
输出: 3
示例 2:

输入: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
输出: 0
注意:

S 和 J 最多含有50个字母。
 J 中的字符不重复。
