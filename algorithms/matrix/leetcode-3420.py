You are given an m x n binary matrix grid.

A row or column is considered palindromic if its values read the same forward and backward.

You can flip any number of cells in grid from 0 to 1, or from 1 to 0.

Return the minimum number of cells that need to be flipped to make all rows and columns palindromic, and the total number of 1's in grid divisible by 4.

 

 Example 1:

 Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]

 Output: 3

 Explanation:



 Example 2:

 Input: grid = [[0,1],[0,1],[0,0]]

 Output: 2

 Explanation:



 Example 3:

 Input: grid = [[1],[1]]

 Output: 2

 Explanation:



  

  Constraints:

  m == grid.length
  n == grid[i].length
  1 <= m * n <= 2 * 105
  0 <= grid[i][j] <= 1
