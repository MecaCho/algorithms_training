1638. Count Substrings That Differ by One Character
Given two strings s and t, find the number of ways you can choose a non-empty substring of s and replace a single character by a different character such that the resulting substring is a substring of t. In other words, find the number of substrings in s that differ from some substring in t by exactly one character.

For example, the underlined substrings in "computer" and "computation" only differ by the 'e'/'a', so this is a valid way.

Return the number of substrings that satisfy the condition above.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aba", t = "baba"
Output: 6
Explanation: The following are the pairs of substrings from s and t that differ by exactly 1 character:
("aba", "baba")
("aba", "baba")
("aba", "baba")
("aba", "baba")
("aba", "baba")
("aba", "baba")
The underlined portions are the substrings that are chosen from s and t.
​​Example 2:
Input: s = "ab", t = "bb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The following are the pairs of substrings from s and t that differ by 1 character:
("ab", "bb")
("ab", "bb")
("ab", "bb")
​​​​The underlined portions are the substrings that are chosen from s and t.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 100
s and t consist of lowercase English letters only.

        res = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            for j in range(len(t)):
                diff = 0
                k = 0
                while i + k < len(s) and j + k < len(t):
                    if s[i + k] != t[j + k]:
                        diff += 1
                    if diff == 1:
                        res += 1
                    elif diff > 1:
                        break
                    k += 1
        return res
