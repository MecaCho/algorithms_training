714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee
Your are given an array of integers prices, for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i; and a non-negative integer fee representing a transaction fee.

You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction. You may not buy more than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.)

Return the maximum profit you can make.

Example 1:
Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
Buying at prices[0] = 1
Selling at prices[3] = 8
Buying at prices[4] = 4
Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
Note:

0 < prices.length <= 50000.
0 < prices[i] < 50000.
0 <= fee < 50000.

714. 买卖股票的最佳时机含手续费
给定一个整数数组 prices，其中第 i 个元素代表了第 i 天的股票价格 ；非负整数 fee 代表了交易股票的手续费用。

你可以无限次地完成交易，但是你每笔交易都需要付手续费。如果你已经购买了一个股票，在卖出它之前你就不能再继续购买股票了。

返回获得利润的最大值。

注意：这里的一笔交易指买入持有并卖出股票的整个过程，每笔交易你只需要为支付一次手续费。

示例 1:

输入: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2
输出: 8
解释: 能够达到的最大利润:
在此处买入 prices[0] = 1
在此处卖出 prices[3] = 8
在此处买入 prices[4] = 4
在此处卖出 prices[5] = 9
总利润: ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
注意:

0 < prices.length <= 50000.
0 < prices[i] < 50000.
0 <= fee < 50000.

Consider the first K stock prices. At the end, the only legal states are that you don't own a share of stock, or that you do. Calculate the most profit you could have under each of these two cases.
