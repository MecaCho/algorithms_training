946. Validate Stack Sequences
Given two integer arrays pushed and popped each with distinct values, return true if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We might do the following sequence:
push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4),
pop() -> 4,
push(5),
pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1
Example 2:

Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]
Output: false
Explanation: 1 cannot be popped before 2.
 

Constraints:

1 <= pushed.length <= 1000
0 <= pushed[i] <= 1000
All the elements of pushed are unique.
popped.length == pushed.length
popped is a permutation of pushed.

946. 验证栈序列
给定 pushed 和 popped 两个序列，每个序列中的 值都不重复，只有当它们可能是在最初空栈上进行的推入 push 和弹出 pop 操作序列的结果时，返回 true；否则，返回 false 。



示例 1：

输入：pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
输出：true
解释：我们可以按以下顺序执行：
push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4), pop() -> 4,
push(5), pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1
示例 2：

输入：pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]
输出：false
解释：1 不能在 2 之前弹出。


提示：

0 <= pushed.length == popped.length <= 1000
0 <= pushed[i], popped[i] < 1000
pushed 是 popped 的排列。

946. Validate Stack Sequences
Given two sequences pushed and popped with distinct values, return true if and only if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack.



Example 1:

Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We might do the following sequence:
push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4), pop() -> 4,
push(5), pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1
Example 2:

Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]
Output: false
Explanation: 1 cannot be popped before 2.


Note:

0 <= pushed.length == popped.length <= 1000
0 <= pushed[i], popped[i] < 1000
pushed is a permutation of popped.
pushed and popped have distinct values.
