153. 寻找旋转排序数组中的最小值
假设按照升序排序的数组在预先未知的某个点上进行了旋转。

( 例如，数组 [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] 可能变为 [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] )。

请找出其中最小的元素。

你可以假设数组中不存在重复元素。

示例 1:

输入: [3,4,5,1,2]
输出: 1
示例 2:

输入: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
输出: 0

153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0

'''
Array was originally in ascending order. Now that the array is rotated, there would be a point in the array where there is a small deflection from the increasing sequence. eg. The array would be something like [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2].

You can divide the search space into two and see which direction to go. Can you think of an algorithm which has O(logN) search complexity?

All the elements to the left of inflection point > first element of the array.
All the elements to the right of inflection point < first element of the array.
