SQL架构
员工表：Employees

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| employee_name | varchar |
| manager_id    | int     |
+---------------+---------+
employee_id 是这个表的主键。
这个表中每一行中，employee_id 表示职工的 ID，employee_name 表示职工的名字，manager_id 表示该职工汇报工作的直线经理。
这个公司 CEO 是 employee_id = 1 的人。
 

用 SQL 查询出所有直接或间接向公司 CEO 汇报工作的职工的 employee_id 。

由于公司规模较小，经理之间的间接关系不超过 3 个经理。

可以以任何顺序返回的结果，不需要去重。

查询结果示例如下：

Employees table:
+-------------+---------------+------------+
| employee_id | employee_name | manager_id |
+-------------+---------------+------------+
| 1           | Boss          | 1          |
| 3           | Alice         | 3          |
| 2           | Bob           | 1          |
| 4           | Daniel        | 2          |
| 7           | Luis          | 4          |
| 8           | Jhon          | 3          |
| 9           | Angela        | 8          |
| 77          | Robert        | 1          |
+-------------+---------------+------------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 2           |
| 77          |
| 4           |
| 7           |
+-------------+

公司 CEO 的 employee_id 是 1.
employee_id 是 2 和 77 的职员直接汇报给公司 CEO。
employee_id 是 4 的职员间接汇报给公司 CEO 4 --> 2 --> 1 。
employee_id 是 7 的职员间接汇报给公司 CEO 7 --> 4 --> 2 --> 1 。
employee_id 是 3, 8 ，9 的职员不会直接或间接的汇报给公司 CEO。 


1270. All People Report to the Given Manager
SQL架构
Table: Employees

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| employee_name | varchar |
| manager_id    | int     |
+---------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with ID employee_id and name employee_name reports his work to his/her direct manager with manager_id
The head of the company is the employee with employee_id = 1.
 

Write an SQL query to find employee_id of all employees that directly or indirectly report their work to the head of the company.

The indirect relation between managers will not exceed 3 managers as the company is small.

Return result table in any order without duplicates.

The query result format is in the following example:

Employees table:
+-------------+---------------+------------+
| employee_id | employee_name | manager_id |
+-------------+---------------+------------+
| 1           | Boss          | 1          |
| 3           | Alice         | 3          |
| 2           | Bob           | 1          |
| 4           | Daniel        | 2          |
| 7           | Luis          | 4          |
| 8           | Jhon          | 3          |
| 9           | Angela        | 8          |
| 77          | Robert        | 1          |
+-------------+---------------+------------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 2           |
| 77          |
| 4           |
| 7           |
+-------------+

The head of the company is the employee with employee_id 1.
The employees with employee_id 2 and 77 report their work directly to the head of the company.
The employee with employee_id 4 report his work indirectly to the head of the company 4 --> 2 --> 1. 
The employee with employee_id 7 report his work indirectly to the head of the company 7 --> 4 --> 2 --> 1.
The employees with employee_id 3, 8 and 9 don't report their work to head of company directly or indirectly. 
```

```
# Write your MySQL query statement below

select a.employee_id as EMPLOYEE_ID
from 
    Employees as a 
    left join 
    Employees as b on a.manager_id = b.employee_id
    left join
    Employees as c on b.manager_id = c.employee_id
    left join
    Employees as d on c.manager_id = d.employee_id
where 
    a.employee_id <> 1 
    and
    d.employee_id = 1 order by employee_id;
